         <li>COVAXIN - BY BHARAT BIOTECH, HYDERABAD (VISIT WEBSITE:  <a href="https://www.bharatbiotech.com/covaxin.html">HERE</a>)</li>
     </ol>
     <h3>Both of these Vaccines have under taken very clinically diagnosed trials Under super vision of a ICMR,WHO with variety of Patients Infected and non-Infected Ranging above 18+ years to 96 years. </h3>
     <hr>
     <h2>Words From WHO-----</h2>
     <h3>In order to respond quickly and effectively to the COVID-19 pandemic, a broad range of candidate COVID-19 vaccines are being investigated globally using various technologies and platforms. These include viral-vectored, protein subunit, nucleic acid (DNA, RNA), live attenuated and inactivated vaccines. Some of these candidates have entered clinical trials.</h3>
     <h4>The COVID-19 candidate vaccine landscape and tracker</h4>
        <h5>The COVID-19 candidate vaccine landscape and tracker database compiles detailed information on COVID-19 vaccine candidates in development.</h5>
        
       <h6>The landscape is updated regularly - twice a week (Tuesday and Friday, 17:00 CET).</h6>
        
        <h4>The landscape:</h4>
     <ol>

       
     <li>provides summary tables of COVID-19 vaccine candidates in both clinical and pre-clinical development;</li>
     <li>provides analysis and visualization for several COVID-19 vaccine candidate categories;</li>
     <li>tracks the progress of each vaccine from pre-clinical, Phase 1, Phase 2 through to Phase 3 efficacy studies and including Phase 4 registered as interventional studies;</li>
      <li>provides links to published reports on safety, immunogenicity and efficacy data of the vaccine candidates;</li>
     <li>includes information on key attributes of each vaccine candidate and</li>
      <li> allows users to search for COVID-19 vaccines through various criteria such as vaccine platform, schedule of vaccination, route of administration, developer, trial phase and clinical endpoints.
        Submission of data</li>
      <li>  All data from independent institutions and vaccine developers are welcome to provide information on vaccine candidates being developed using the information template. Submitted data will be made openly accessible on a regular basis to enable fast data sharing.</li>
    </ol>    
        <h3>Data extraction tools and sources</h3>
        <h6>To ensure the latest information is available, the landscape will be updated twice a week (Tuesday and Friday, 17:00 CET) by searching, gathering and cross-checking data from multiple sources such as the Cochrane vaccine mapping tool, PubMed, ClinicalTrials.gov, WHO ICTRP and from a network of researchers and industry for new candidate vaccines by screening registered trials for clinical information.  Where data is missing, we either do not add any information (blank cells) or we supplement information gathered from press or public releases.  We welcome your feedback to help us update or make necessary changes, please note any updates will only be done twice a week.</h6>
